The left player begins the first turn. He can move the ball in every direction, one field further.
After one player made a move, the other player can move the ball. If one player gets with the ball to a goal the match is over and the player, who is not owning the goal in which the ball is, will win the match.

-> Here player 1 wins the match

Every made move will be marked with an arrow, pointing in the direction of movement. A ball cannot moved again from those points with the same direction (but the ball can moved between those two points if it is another direction)

If a ball lands on a field, which has been already touched once, it bounces away. Then the player must make another move from the second point and can choose the direction.

If the ball cannot moved anymore, the match will be a tie.
